            Hii Babbyy..!!❤️. You are my best friend. One of my favorite person in the entire world. I know you from the past year, we became quick friends. 
            Thanks to dhanuvarsha and her bag I got to meet my soulmate. I knew from the start that I wont ever lose you. I have had some great memories 
            with you. But last week was one of the best times that I had with you. Thank You for giving me that. You were always there for me, even in the 
            middle of nights, even when you are too damn sleepy. You never left my side..!! You always cared for me and loved me even though I am such 
            an idiot. I know that I sometimes have been an asshole to you. Sorry, for all the trouble that I caused. You are an idiot babe. But you are
            my idiot. Yes, I am gonna give us a chance. I am gonna take you as my love. I am gonna be yours. I am gonna love you so much that you are gonna 
            forget the rest of the world and only concentrate on me. <br>
